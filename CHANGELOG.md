# Changelog

## v1.0.0 (September 2023)

### Features

- Add support for `whence=2` in `PackedObjectReader.seek` [\[5515ab6\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/5515ab6d75581b36ecb3e0b8ff37407e05abefda)
- Add support for changing compression when repacking, and add auto compression heuristics [\[599e87c\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/599e87c852427e02062f04f5f3d2276013410710)
- Improve efficiency when accessing packed compressed objects [\[10edd63\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/10edd6395455d7c59361e608396b672289d8de58)

### Changes

- A number of API methods changed the return type from bare dictionaries to dataclass instances [\[7a63462\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/7a634626ea3e5f35aa3cdd458daf9d8b825d759a)

  - `Container.get_object_stream_and_meta -> ObjectMeta`
  - `Container.get_objects_meta -> ObjectMeta`
  - `Container.get_object_meta -> ObjectMeta`
  - `Container.count_objects -> ObjectCount`
  - `Container.get_total_size -> TotalSize`
  - `Container.validate -> ValidationIssues`

  The dataclasses are importable from `disk_objectstore.dataclasses`.

- A number of API methods replaced using `os.path` with `str` paths, for `pathlib.Path` [\[df96142\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/df9614236b7d420fb610313d70ffae51e7aead75)
  The following methods now return a `pathlib.Path` instance:

  - `Container.get_folder`
  - `LazyOpener.path`

- Various improvements to docs and code [\[5ba9316\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/5ba93162cd49d9b1ca7149c502349bfb06833255)

- Removed uneeded `ablog` dependencies [\[8165f58\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/commit/8165f58fefdd40b55555eef9a2d40ee280593232)

## v0.6.0 (September 2021)

- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPGRADE: Remove Python support for 3.5 and 3.6, and add support for 3.9.
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPGRADE: SQLAlchemy v1.4 (with v2 API) [\[#114\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/114)
- ‚ú® NEW: Add basic CLI [\[#117\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/117) (see README.md for details)
- üîß MAINTAIN: Add type annotations and mypy type checking [\[#113\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/113)

## v0.5.0 (November 2020)

- Various general (but very important) speed improvements [\[#96\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/96) [\[#102\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/102)
- Add callbacks to a number of functions (e.g. export, add_objects_to_pack, ... to allow showing progress bars or similar indicators [\[#96\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/96)
- Implement repacking (at least when not changing hashing or compression) [\[#96\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/96)
- Remove `export` function, implement `import_objects` function instead, to be called on the other side (it's more efficient) [\[#96\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/96)
- Add support for VACUUMing operations on the SQLite database (very important for efficiency) [\[#96\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/96)

- Add concept of (unique) `container_id` [\[#97\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/97)
- Generalize the compression algorithm implementation, and multiple algorithms are supported now [\[#99\]](https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/99)

## v0.4.0 (20 July 2020)

- Major robustness improvements and new functionality (possibility to pack while using the repository, tested on all platforms)
- Not deleting loose files when packing; now there is a `clean_storage()` function to do it afterwards, as a maintenance operation
- Backward-incompatible change to the Container format (now it expects a `duplicates` folder, so old repositories do not work out of the box)
- Added various functionality to delete objects, validate the packs, list all objects, possibility to seek() into returned objects
- Added continuous-integation benchmarks
- Various bugfixes

## v0.3.0 (22 June 2020)

- Changed the logic of packing: now packs are not determined anymore from the first few characters of the UUID/hash, but they are sequential integers with capped max size
- Complete major rewrite of the library, where now objects are deduplicated and use a SHA256 hash to be identified. This is a backward-incompatible version, but provides much higher robustness and features, making it almost production ready (only a few useful functions need still to be implemented to facilitate repository management, like the option to perform a full repack of a repository.

## v0.2.1 (13 April 2020)

- Improving testing and continuous integration, badges, and homepage

## v0.2.0 (10 April 2020)

- Rename of the project and implementation of a number of functions

## v0.1.0 (1 April 2020)

- This is the very first version. Uses random UUIDs to identify objects.
