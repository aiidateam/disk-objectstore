"""A small script that, every few seconds, adds a few objects to an object store, and then tries to read it again.

This is used to test concurrency while using the container and packing at the same time.

The script is supposed to be run in parallel with many other "locusts", possibly with a (single) packer at the
same time, to check if there are issues while all of these work at the same time.

The script will also write the objects it created (in a safe way also when there is concurrency) in a folder
(defined by the -s option). Then each locust will try to read back *all* files written by *all* locusts (including
itself) and check if the checksums are correct.
